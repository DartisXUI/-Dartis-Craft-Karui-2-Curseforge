**MODPACK NOTES:**

**1.12.2 Forge Based**

**Designed around Casual Enjoyment rather than Strict Gameplay, examples are:**

- 1 Ore to 3 Ingots in Tinkers Construct Smeltery *[Not Guaranteed]*, 1:3 Returns helps newer and weaker Players with Alloying... A lot!
- Mod that enables Keeping Inventory & Disables Mob Griefing
- No Mobs in Overworld thanks to Hunting Dimensions Config Edit *[Spawners will still work fine]*.
- However, Mob Fighting is now OPT IN via the Hunting Dimension Portal, for when you are ready...

FEATURES:

- Survival Plus. No Magic. And just a Taste of TECH... and Super Powers of course.
- What TECH that has been included has been restricted in crafting _[eg: all of EnderIO cannot be crafted but there is a Dungeon with it's Direct Modifier for Tinkers Construct]_.
- LOTS of custom world generation - Exploration is a must! Dungeons and Loot galore! Even maybe the Central Spire of Atlantis to find for the Stargate Fans.
- LOTS of weird and wonderful Mods: Lucraft, Heroes Expansion, Waystones & Stargate Network to list some
- Birds Foods instead of Pam's Harvestcraft - same idea, except no world gen _[Berry Gardens, Apple Trees, etc]_ and the lag that comes with it on weaker pc/laptops...

**TIP:** Speaking of Stargate Network. If your Gate has SKY ACCESS during a THUNDERSTORM, dial it! There's a 5% chance the Gate will be dramatically redirected, Maybe into a Hidden "Ancient Repository Cavern"! *[the LOOT!].

QUESTBOOK NOTES:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Trxhnyw1YMIfzWKwVbwnTVoKCf32DMWlmhCT_gAZfjw/edit?usp=share_link
 
- Google Doc Format.
- It is written as a guide on each Mod in the Pack as well as the timing/order I felt the Player should attempt achieving each Questbook Entry.
- Questbook was written from a Vanilla Player's Perspective, sorry if it's a little too detailed, but my Test Players needed this _[eg: Starts with the differences between Vanilla and Modded (JEI & JourneyMap Explanations and such) ]_.
